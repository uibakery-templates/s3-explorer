<h3>Tool components</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    S3 Explorer Page:
    <ul>
      <li>The bucket list shows S3 buckets in your AWS account. You can switch between S3 buckets to investigate S3 bucket usage.</li>
      <li>The bucket file list displays the file path, last modification time, and size; it supports listing files by wildcard pattern. You can view the file contents for supported file formats and detailed information about the file. It allows you to manage each file: downloading a file from the S3 bucket, copying or moving a file to another location within the S3 bucket, and deleting a file from the S3 bucket.</li>
      <li>The S3 usage diagram allows you to explore the structure of the S3 bucket and understand the size of a folder or file.</li>

  </li>
  <li>
    S3 Searching Page:
    <ul>
      <li>Search inside each file in the S3 bucket is essential when you store logs or other textual data in the S3 bucket. You can search for text patterns in selected file extensions, similar to how you do when using <code>grep</code>.</li>
